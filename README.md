# honours-web-app
The project was developed on a university hosted repository, so commit history is not included.

This is a prototype Rails web app for university honours project.
Royal Adelaide Hospital wanted prototype software to increase adherence to medical protocols in the Emergency Department (ED).

We created a web app for expert clinicians to input and edit the latest evidence-based medical protocols (known as clinical pathways).
We created a corresponding mobile app for patient-facing clinicians in the emergency department to interactively follow the medical protocols.

We evaluated our solution with 8 RAH clinicians; 7/8 would use the web app, 8/8 would use the mobile app.

I developed it in a 2 person team for around half of the duration of the project, then I worked on it individually.
